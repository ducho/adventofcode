## Advent of Code: 2018 Solutions

This year I'm doing things a bit differently. Usually I do this with an interpreted language, but
this year we're going compiled. We're going with Kotlin and Gradle,
so all of my solutions will be run by the same executable.

### Running the Solutions

    $ gradle run --args <day#>

For example, to run the first solution:

    $ gradle run --args 1
